We love our CCUSA map, and we're making a tutorial to show everyone how to re-create a similar product! 

# Background on the CCUSA Map

In early 2017, DataKind DC teamed up with CCUSA to produce a Disaster Vulnerability Risk map, the outcome was a very fine and useful tool that we are immensely proud of. By coincidence, we launced it right before the devastating hurricane season in the fall of 2017. Our map was used by both CCUSA and Red Cross in related relief efforts. By request of Red Cross, our team of volunteers extended our map's coverage to Puerto Rico.
