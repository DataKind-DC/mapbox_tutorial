### Background on the CCUSA Map

In early 2017, DataKind DC started working with MapBox and CCUSA to produce a Disaster Vulnerability Risk map, the outcome was a very fine and useful tool that we are immensely proud of. By coincidence, we launched it right before the devastating hurricane season in the fall of 2017. Our map was used by both CCUSA and Red Cross in related relief efforts. By request of Red Cross, our team of volunteers extended our map's coverage to Puerto Rico. We are so proud of our volunteers and collective efforts to create this impactful tool.

## Starter Tasks

To start on the tutorial process: we need to start by documenting, cleaning up, and stripping down the code. Once we create a generalized template, we can start writing up the tutorial.
